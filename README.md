This is a University project, where students could apply data structure concepts to a real-life project. At the end of this project, my team would be able to effectively implement different data structures from scratch, build an XML editor and convert XML to JSON. 

## Idea
XML (Extensible Markup Language) is one of the most famous formats for storing and sharing information among different devices. Some text editors such as Sublime Text are able to parse such files and do some basic operations. In this project, you will work on developing a GUI (Graphical User Interface) based program to parse and visualize an XML file.

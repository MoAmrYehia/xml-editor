This is a University project, where students could apply software engineering concepts on a real-life project. At the end of this project, my team would be able to submit UML diagrams, system requirements and user interface design.

## Idea
XML (Extensible Markup Language) is one of the most famous formats for storing and sharing information among different devices. Some text editors such as Sublime Text are able to parse such files and do some basic operations. In this project, you will work on developing a GUI (Graphical User Interface) based program to parse and visualize an XML file.
